      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a master's student in computer science working in the Trust Lab at Dartmouth College focusing in computer security and binary analysis. My bachelors degree is in pure mathematics and computer science so I generally lean towards intersections of these two fields. I am a fan of the standardization and canonicalization of computer science curricula and theory, perhaps with a tinge of bias from my math background. </p>

      <p>- A Census of Cubic Fourfolds over ùîΩ‚ÇÇ [<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/0000-000-00/S0025-5718-2024-04010-3/" target="_blank">link</a>] [<a href="cubic_fourfolds.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Asher Auel, Avinash Kulkarni, Jack Petok, and Jonah Weinbaum</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p> - Building a Bombe [<a href="https://github.com/JonahWeinbaum/building-a-bombe" target="_blank">github</a>] [<a href="bombe_presentation.pdf" target="_blank">presentation]</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Examining the permutation and probabilty theory that allowed cryptographers to best German encryption during WWII. New results in permutation theory allow for a more holistic analysis of the Bombe's efficacy</p>
      <p> - SVMs with Geodesic Hyperspheres [<a href="https://github.com/JonahWeinbaum/geodesic-hyperspheres" target="_blank">github</a>]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Developing theory and tools which allows SVMs to generalize to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds allowing for more accurate classification even with sparse data sets</p>
      <p> - Dynamic Java Deserialization Filtering via Taint Tracking<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Preventing deserialization vulnerabilities in Java by analyzing serialize data being passed over the network in real-time using taint tracking</p>

      <h2>Dogmatic Ramblings</h2>
      <p> I like to imagine what ideas would look like upon rediscovery. If a theory disappeared tomorrow, what would it look like in its recreation and reimplementation? Would we make the same choices and formalizations, or were such things only created out of the context of their time? I find that on reanalyzing old or "completed" ideas, that is, ideas that were stored in a box somewhere as a tool us computer scientists use, there is often more to be uncovered. The recipe of sifting through progress prior to its peak allows us to battle stagnation of ideas by imagining what these ideas would look like were we not outright told the solution.</p>
