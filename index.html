      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a masters student in computer science at Dartmouth College focusing in computer security and binary analysis. My bachelors degree is in pure mathematics and computer science so I generally lean towards intersections of these two fields. I am a fan of the standardization and canonicalization of computer science curricula and theory, perhaps with a tinge of bias from my math background. </p>

      <h2>Dogmatic Ramblings</h2>
      <p> I like to imagine what ideas would look like upon rediscovery. If a theory disappeared tomorrow, what would it look like in its recreation and reimplementation? Would we make the same choices and formalizations, or were such things only created out of the context of their time? I find that on reanalyzing old or "completed" ideas, that is, ideas that were stored in a box somewhere as a tool us computer scientists use, there is often more to be uncovered. The recipe of sifting through progress prior to its peak allows us to battle stagnation of ideas by imagining what these ideas would look like were we not outright told the solution.</p>
